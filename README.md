## Development Tools

### Claude Code Hooks

This project includes comprehensive Claude Code hooks for enhanced development workflow automation. The hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and provide:

- **Command Logging**: All bash commands are logged to `.claude/logs/`
- **Safety Checks**: Dangerous commands are blocked, warnings for protected branch operations
- **Auto-formatting**: Code is automatically formatted with Biome after edits
- **Lint Checks**: Automatic linting after file modifications
- **Discord Notifications**: Real-time updates on development progress
- **Session Summaries**: Comprehensive reports of changes made during each session

To customize hooks, edit the scripts in `.claude/hooks/` or modify `.claude/settings.json`.
